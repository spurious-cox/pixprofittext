# Notarize PixProFitText.app and wrap it in a distributable DMG — v1.1.0
#
# v1.1.0 also puts a "READ ME FIRST.txt" in the DMG and rewrites the Homebrew
# cask's version and sha256, so brew never serves a DMG the cask no longer
# describes.
#
# Run ./build.sh first; this takes dist/PixProFitText.app as it finds it.
#
# Notarization uses the same keychain profile as Stache, the PixPro apps and
# KBD, so no password lives here or gets typed. If the profile is ever lost:
#   xcrun notarytool store-credentials "PixProNotary" \
#       --apple-id <appleid> --team-id RUDN8D7ZN9
#
# Both the app and the DMG are notarized and stapled. Stapling the app
# matters because that is what gets dragged out of the DMG; stapling the DMG
# matters because that is what gets downloaded. Notarizing only one of the
# two leaves a Gatekeeper warning on the other.
#
# Unlike Stache, this app has NO LaunchAgent — nothing relaunches it — so
# there is no agent to unload around the install, and it must be launched by
# hand afterwards.

PixProFitText $VERSION

WHAT IT IS
    Fits a block of text inside an irregular Pixelmator Pro shape, at the
    largest size that stays inside the outline.

INSTALLING
    Drag PixProFitText onto the Applications folder beside it.

UPDATING
    Quit PixProFitText first if it is running. Unlike Stache it has no login
    agent, so nothing restarts it - but replacing a running app is still
    unreliable.

IT NEEDS PIXELMATOR PRO
    The app does nothing on its own: it drives Pixelmator Pro. The first
    time you use it, macOS asks whether to allow it to control Pixelmator
    Pro, and it cannot work until that is allowed.

    Both Pixelmator Pro 3.x and the Creator Studio build are supported; it
    binds to whichever one has a document open.

USING IT
    Select a shape layer in Pixelmator, type or paste your text, press Try
    to see it, press Apply to place it. The Info button explains what the
    app calculates and what it leaves to you - line height in particular,
    which no script can set and which is the intended finishing touch.

HOMEBREW
    brew install --cask spurious-cox/tap/pixprofittext
